/** \ingroup avr_string
    \fn char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src)
    \brief Concatenate two strings.

    The strcat() function appends the src string to the dest string
    overwriting the '\\0' character at the end of dest, and then adds a
    terminating '\\0' character.  The strings may not overlap, and the dest
    string must have enough space for the result.

    \returns The strcat() function returns a pointer to the resulting string
    dest.  */
