/** \ingroup avr_pgmspace
    \fn PGM_P strchrnul_P(PGM_P s, int c)

    The strchrnul_P() function is like strchr_P() except that if \p c is
    not found in \p s, then it returns a pointer to the null byte at the
    end of \p s, rather than \c NULL. (Glibc, GNU extension.)

    \return The strchrnul_P() function returns a pointer to the matched
    character, or a pointer to the null byte at the end of \p s (i.e.,
    \c s+strlen(s)) if the character is not found.	*/
