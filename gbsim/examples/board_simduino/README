This will emulate an arduino. Right now it loads the bootloader, then wait on it's "serial port"
(a pseudo tty) until someone programs it... eventualy it timesout and run the previous
app that was programmed.


Once that bridge is setup, launch simduino:

% ./simduino
	Starting atmega328 - flashend 7fff ramend 08ff e2end 03ff
	atmega328 init
	read_ihex_file: ATmegaBOOT_168_atmega328.ihex, unsupported check type 03
	Booloader 7800: 1950
	uart_pty_init bridge on port *** /dev/pts/11 ***
	uart_pty_connect: /tmp/simavr-uart0 now points to /dev/pts/11
	note: export SIMAVR_UART_XTERM=1 and install picocom to get a terminal
	UART-0 configured to 0010 = 58823 bps (x1), 5 data 1 stop
	Roughtly 136 usec per bytes

What that is done, you have a few seconds to program it:

% avrdude -p m328p -c arduino -P /tmp/simavr-uart0 -U flash:w:atmega328p_dummy_blinky.hex

	avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

	avrdude done.  Thank you.

simduino will display that:

	Erasing page 0001 (128)

	Writing page 0002 (128)
	Erasing page 0003 (128)
	Writing page 0003 (128)

And then jump to the program that was programmed. The example doesn't do anything useful, it's
a placeholder...
